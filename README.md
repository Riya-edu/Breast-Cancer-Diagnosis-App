# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-App
 Interactive machine-learning web application using the Streamlit framework. In this comprehensive project, I built a machine-learning dashboard to predict whether a cell cluster is benign or malignant using Python and Streamlit.


What is the project?

The project is a web application for predicting breast cancer diagnosis using logistic regression. It is built with Streamlit, a Python library that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications.


What is the aim of the project?

The aim of the project is to provide a user-friendly tool for predicting whether a breast cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on input features. The model used for prediction is logistic regression, and the application is designed to help in the early detection of breast cancer.


What is the tech stack used?

The tech stack used in the project includes:
Streamlit: For creating the web application interface.
Logistic Regression: As the machine learning model for predicting cancer diagnosis.
Python: As the primary programming language for both the model and the application.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the logistic regression model.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
